# Cloud-based ETL Pipeline ðŸš€

This project demonstrates how to build a scalable **ETL pipeline** for batch data processing in the cloud.  
It uses **Python, Apache Airflow, and AWS S3/BigQuery** to extract, transform, and load data efficiently.  

## Features
- Data ingestion from multiple sources (CSV, API, DB)
- Transformation with Pandas/PySpark
- Loading into cloud warehouse (AWS/BigQuery)
- Automated scheduling with Airflow

## Future Work
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Unit tests for transformations
